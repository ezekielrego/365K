# Kurima365 Expo App â€“ Development Steps

This guide outlines the focused, step-by-step process to develop the Kurima365 application using Expo, covering setup, core features, offline strategies, and deployment.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed).
- Install Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Initialize a new Expo project: `expo init kurima365-app`
- Set up version control (e.g., GitHub repository).

---

## 2. Define App Structure & Navigation
- Plan folder structure (components, screens, services, utils, etc.).
- Install and configure React Navigation for multi-screen support.
- Set up navigation flows: Auth, Main App, Admin/Agent, and Offline/USSD flows.

---

## 3. UI/UX Design
- Design wireframes/mockups for all user types (farmer, buyer, agent, admin).
- Choose a UI library (e.g., React Native Paper, NativeBase) for consistent styling.
- Implement responsive layouts for mobile and tablet.

---

## 4. Authentication & KYC
- Integrate user registration and login (email/phone, password, OTP if needed).
- Build KYC forms for ID, address, and selfie uploads.
- Implement secure storage for user sessions (AsyncStorage/SecureStore).

---

## 5. Core Features Implementation
- **Marketplace:**
  - Crop listing creation (with photo/video upload, location tagging).
  - Product browsing, search, and filtering for buyers.
  - Order placement and management.
- **Wallet & Payments:**
  - Integrate digital wallet (escrow logic, balance display).
  - Payment and payout flows.
- **Messaging:**
  - In-app chat between buyers and farmers.
  - Automated chatbot for FAQs.
- **Notifications:**
  - Push notifications for app users.
  - SMS integration for offline alerts.

---

## 6. Offline & PWA Support
- Enable Expo PWA support for web/offline use.
- Implement data caching (e.g., with Redux Persist, SQLite, or MMKV).
- Design app to gracefully handle offline/online transitions and sync.

---

## 7. USSD & SMS Integration
- Integrate with backend APIs for USSD and SMS (requires coordination with mobile operators).
- Ensure app logic supports USSD-triggered actions and SMS notifications.

---

## 8. Agent & Admin Features
- Build agent dashboard for KYC, listings, and support tasks.
- Implement admin controls for moderation, reporting, and dispute resolution.

---

## 9. AI & Smart Tools
- Integrate AI-powered price recommendation (via backend API or local logic).
- Add market trends and weather info (API integration).

---

## 10. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Write unit and integration tests (Jest, React Native Testing Library).
- Conduct manual testing for all user flows (including offline/USSD scenarios).
- Gather feedback from pilot users (farmers, agents, buyers).

---

## 11. Deployment & Launch
- Configure app.json for Expo build (icons, splash, permissions).
- Build and test for Android, iOS, and web (PWA).
- Publish to Expo, Google Play Store, and Apple App Store.
- Set up monitoring, analytics, and crash reporting.

---

## 12. Post-Launch & Iteration
- Monitor user feedback and analytics.
- Release updates and bug fixes.
- Expand features based on user needs and business goals.

**Note:** Some features (USSD, SMS, AI) require backend/API support and partnerships with mobile operators. Coordinate closely with backend and operations teams throughout development.
